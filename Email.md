Application for AWS DevOps Engineer Position at Deqode

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the DevOps Engineer position at Rubrik. I am Jash Hinger, a junior DevOps engineer at AppPerfect Corporation, with a B.Tech degree and a CGPA of 9.2 from Techno India NJR Institute of Technology.

I began my career as a Software Engineer at AppPerfect Corp., working as a full stack developer with the MERN stack and gaining experience in Selenium testing. Recently, I transitioned into a junior DevOps role, focusing on DevOps and cloud technology. I have worked with Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, Terraform, AWS, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment strategies.

I have been involved in full stack and DevOps projects since my freshman year of college, with proficiency in JavaScript, C++, Python, ReactJS, NodeJS, MongoDB, SQL, Docker, AWS, and more. I am familiar with Agile and Scrum methodologies and have experience developing predictive models for stock price forecasting during a Data Science internship.

This journey has given me insights into the complete project lifecycle and deployment strategies for cloud platforms. I am a motivated and results-oriented individual, always looking to improve my skills and take on new challenges.

I have attached my resume for your review. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Jash Hinger
