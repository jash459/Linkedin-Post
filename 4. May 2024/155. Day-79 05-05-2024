GitOps: The Future of Infrastructure Management 🚀

Think of GitOps as your infrastructure's personal command center. Here's why it's a game-changer:

✪ What is GitOps:

1️⃣  Operational approach for platform engineers and software developers. 🚀
2️⃣  Every aspect of a project’s infrastructure stored in git repositories. 🔧
3️⃣  Triggered updates to cloud infrastructure or application via git commits. 🔄
4️⃣  Relies on Git as the single source of truth for builds and deployments. 🌐
5️⃣  Commonly used by organizations with Kubernetes as their container orchestration platform. 🐳

✪ Implementation Example: 

1️⃣  Platform engineering team uses Terraform to build a DigitalOcean Managed Kubernetes Cluster. 🛠️
2️⃣  FluxCD and Helm are installed in the Kubernetes cluster. 🔄
3️⃣  Changes to infrastructure are made by editing Terraform files in Git, triggering FluxCD to apply the changes. 📦
4️⃣  Application development team stores Docker images in DigitalOcean Container Registry and deploys applications using Helm manifests in Git. 🚢
