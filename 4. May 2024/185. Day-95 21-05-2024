Ever wonder how Disney makes magic feel SO real? ✨

I recently attended a fascinating robotics camp, and got some insider knowledge...

Disney's secret sauce? Robots that aren't just machines...they have personalities!  During a recent demo, check this out:

1️⃣   A childlike robot burst out of a box  📦
2️⃣   It skated smoothly across the stage  🛼
3️⃣   Disney engineers used motion-capture to make its movements eerily human 😲
4️⃣   The goal: robots that spark an emotional connection with visitors  💖
5️⃣   Think about the potential for theme parks! 🤩

P.S.  Could Disney robots be the future of immersive entertainment? 🤔
