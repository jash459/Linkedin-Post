Ready to dive into the world of secure network connections? 💻🔐

Let's explore tunneling techniques and how they keep your data safe online.

✪ Tunneling Techniques:
1️⃣  Encapsulation of IP Packets - Involves placing an IP packet within another IP packet to hide its content during transmission. 🔄
2️⃣  Example Scenario - Sending private network traffic over a public network, like the internet, securely. 🔒
3️⃣  How Encapsulation Works - The original IP packet is encapsulated within a new packet with a new header for transmission. 📦
4️⃣  Significance of the Term "Tunneling" - Describes the process of transmitting data privately through a public network. 🚇

✪ Types of Tunneling Protocols:
1️⃣  Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) - Simple, point-to-point tunneling protocol often used to create private networks over the internet. 🛡️
2️⃣  Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) - A suite of protocols used to secure internet protocol (IP) communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet in a data stream. 🔐
3️⃣  IP-in-IP - Encapsulates an IP packet within another IP packet, used for forwarding IP datagrams over an IP network. 🌐
4️⃣  Secure Shell (SSH) - A cryptographic network protocol for secure data communication, remote command-line login, remote command execution, and other secure network services. 🐚
5️⃣  Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) - A method for implementing virtual private networks that creates secure point-to-point connections over the internet. 🌐
6️⃣  Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol (SSTP) - A VPN protocol that allows VPN client traffic to pass through firewalls securely. 🔥
7️⃣  Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) - A tunneling protocol used to support virtual private networks (VPNs) or as part of the delivery of services by ISPs. 🌐
8️⃣  Virtual Extensible Local Area Network (VXLAN) - A network virtualization technology that attempts to address the scalability problems associated with large cloud computing deployments. ☁️

✪ SSL Tunneling:
1️⃣  Definition of SSL Tunneling - SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) tunneling is a method of using the SSL protocol to encrypt data transmitted over an unsecured network. 🛡️
2️⃣  Functionality of SSL Tunneling - SSL tunneling enables secure transmission of data between a client and a server, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of the data. 🔒
