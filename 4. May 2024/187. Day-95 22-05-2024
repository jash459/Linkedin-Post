Ready to take your Kubernetes game to the next level?  Let's dive into the power of extensibility! 🚀

I recently attended an awesome camp on Kubernetes extensibility and wanted to share some of the key takeaways...

✪ Extensibility in Kubernetes:

1️⃣  Vital for customizing business needs without modifying upstream source code 🔄
2️⃣  Allows developers to contribute back to upstream 🤝
3️⃣  Various extension mechanisms available in Kubernetes 🧩
#kubernetes

✪ Ways to Extend Kubernetes Scheduler:
 
→  Clone and Modify Upstream Source:
1️⃣  Not recommended due to difficulties in aligning with upstream changes 🚫
→  Run Separate Scheduler:
1️⃣  Co-existence of multiple schedulers can lead to issues ❗
2️⃣  Requires in-depth knowledge of Kubernetes architecture 🧠
→  Scheduler Extender:
1️⃣  Configurable webhooks for filtering and prioritizing 🔗
2️⃣  Compatible with upstream scheduler 👍
→  Scheduler Framework:
1️⃣  Comprehensive solution for extending scheduler 🛠️
2️⃣  Official recommended way to extend scheduling 🏅

✪ Functioning of Scheduler Extender:

→  Startup Parameters:
1️⃣  Config file specifying scheduler parameters, including extender configurations 📄
→  Extender Workflow:
1️⃣  Webhooks for filtering and prioritizing in scheduling cycle 🔄
#functioning

✪ Implementation Details:

1️⃣  Writing HTTP service as scheduler extender 📝
2️⃣  Developing custom filtering and prioritizing logic 💡
3️⃣  Running example Deployment to showcase extender functionality 🚀
#implementation

✪ Limitations of Scheduler Extender:

1️⃣  Communication costs with HTTP(s) data transfer 🌐
2️⃣  Limited extension points (Filter and Prioritize phases) ⚠️
3️⃣  Preferable for further filtering rather than adding new nodes 🆕
4️⃣  Challenges with cache sharing and maintaining cluster status 🔄
#limitations

✪ Future Developments:

1️⃣  Introduction of Scheduler Framework to address extender limitations 🔜
2️⃣  Scheduled for beta/GA release date 📅
3️⃣  Recommended for advanced scheduling extensions 🔝
4️⃣  Ongoing updates in Kubernetes ecosystem for enhanced extensibility 🔄.

PS:  The Scheduler Extender has limits, but the upcoming Scheduler Framework is gonna blow those away!  Keep an eye on those Kubernetes updates 👀
