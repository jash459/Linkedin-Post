Think of canary deployments like a test drive before buying a brand-new car.  You get to try out shiny new features in a real-world setting, without risking a major breakdown on the highway!  

Let's dive in:

✪ Canary Deployments Overview

1️⃣  Canary deployments test new features and upgrades in production without affecting user experience. 🚀
2️⃣  Can be implemented on any infrastructure and are a deployment strategy in Kubernetes. 🔧
3️⃣  Utilize selectors and labels to manage deployments within Kubernetes clusters. 🏷️

✪ Setting up Canary Deployment on Kubernetes

→  Step 1: Pull Docker Image
1️⃣  Use docker pull nginx to download the Nginx image. ⬇️
2️⃣  Verify image availability with docker image ls. ✔️

→  Step 2: Create the Kubernetes Deployment
1️⃣  Define deployment in a yaml file (e.g., nginx-deployment.yaml). 📝
2️⃣  Configuration includes specifying replicas, labels, image, resources, and ports. ⚙️
3️⃣  Deploy pods with k apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml. 🚀

→  Step 3: Create the Service
1️⃣  Establish a service definition to route requests to pods. 🛣️
2️⃣  Service type can be LoadBalancer, balancing workloads based on specified labels. ⚖️
3️⃣  Deploy service with kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.service.yaml. 🚀

→  Step 4: Check First Version of Cluster
1️⃣  Verify the service is running and access the deployed content (e.g., http://localhost:8888). 🔍
2️⃣  Ensure the initial version (version 1) is accessible. 🌐
 
→  Step 5: Create a Canary Deployment
1️⃣  Define a new deployment for the canary version (e.g., nginx-canary-deployment.yaml). 📝
2️⃣  Configure the canary deployment pods with specific labels and image. ⚙️
3️⃣  Deploy canary pods with k apply -f nginx-canary-deployment.yaml. 🚀

→  Step 6: Run the Canary Deployment
1️⃣  Modify the service to route traffic to the canary pods (version 2). 🔄
2️⃣  Monitor traffic distribution between version 1 and version 2 pods. 📊

→  Step 7: Monitor the Canary Behavior
1️⃣  Observe and evaluate the performance of canary deployment. 🧐
2️⃣  Decide whether to roll back or upgrade based on canary behavior assessment. ⚖️
