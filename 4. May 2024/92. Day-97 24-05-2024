Ever wondered how your browser finds websites so quickly? It's all thanks to DNS magic! ✨

DNS, or the Domain Name System, is like the phonebook of the internet. It translates human-friendly domain names (like [invalid URL removed]) into machine-readable IP addresses : 

✪ Types of DNS Queries:

→ Recursive Query: 
1️⃣  In a recursive query, a DNS client requests a DNS server to respond with the requested resource record or an error message if the resolver can't find the record. 🔍

→  Iterative Query: 
1️⃣  The DNS client allows a DNS server to return the best answer it can. 🌐
2️⃣  If the queried DNS server does not have a match for the query name, it will return a referral to a DNS server authoritative for a lower level of the domain namespace. 🔗
3️⃣  This process continues with additional DNS servers down the query chain until either an error or timeout occurs. ⏳

→  Non-recursive Query: 
1️⃣  This occurs when a DNS resolver client queries a DNS server for a record that it has access to either because it's authoritative for the record or the record exists inside of its cache. 🗂️

✪ DNS Caching:

→  What is DNS Caching? 
1️⃣  DNS caching involves storing data closer to the requesting client to improve performance and reliability for data requests by temporarily storing DNS records. 🗄️

→  Locations of DNS Caching: 
1.  Browser DNS Caching: 
1️⃣  Modern web browsers cache DNS records for a set amount of time, reducing processing steps and improving load times. 🌐
2️⃣  The browser cache is the first location checked for the requested record when a DNS record is requested. 🔍

2.  Operating System (OS) Level DNS Caching: 
1️⃣  The OS level DNS resolver serves as the second and last local stop before a DNS query leaves the machine. 🖥️
2️⃣  Stub Resolver handles the query, first checking its own cache and then sending the DNS query with a recursive flag set to a DNS recursive resolver inside the ISP. 🚀

3.  DNS Recursive Resolver inside ISP: 
1️⃣  Checks if the requested host-to-IP-address translation is already stored inside its local persistence layer. 🗂️
2️⃣  Has additional functionality depending on the types of records it has in its cache. 🛠️
