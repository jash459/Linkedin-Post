Just wrapped up an insightful camp on congestion control? 🤯 Let me break down what I learned and why it matters for network performance! 👇

Open Loop Congestion Control: Prevention is Key 🗝️

✪ Open Loop Congestion Control
1️⃣  Handling of lost or corrupted packets: Implementing strategies to detect and retransmit lost or corrupted packets, ensuring data integrity. 🔍
2️⃣  Designing retransmission timers: Setting timers for retransmission based on network conditions to minimize delays and improve efficiency. ⏲️
3️⃣  Optimization of efficiency: Continuously optimizing the congestion control algorithms to improve network performance and reduce latency. 🔄
#Open Loop

✪ Discarding Policy
1️⃣  Partial discarding of corrupted or less sensitive packets: Identifying and discarding packets that are corrupted or less critical to maintain overall message integrity. 📦
2️⃣  Maintenance of message quality: Ensuring that discarding policies do not compromise the quality or integrity of the transmitted message. 👨‍💻

✪ Acknowledgment Policy
1️⃣  Impact of acknowledgments on network load: Evaluating the impact of acknowledgment messages on network resources and optimizing their usage. 📶
2️⃣  Approaches to prevent congestion related to acknowledgments: Implementing strategies to minimize the impact of acknowledgment messages on network congestion. 🚫
#Policy

✪ Admission Policy
1️⃣  Mechanism to prevent congestion: Implementing admission control mechanisms to limit the number of concurrent transmissions and prevent congestion. 🚦
2️⃣  Checking resource requirements before transmitting: Verifying the availability of resources before allowing a new transmission to prevent congestion. ✅

✪ Closed Loop Congestion Control
1️⃣  Backpressure: Nodes experiencing congestion signal back to the sender to reduce the rate of packet transmission, alleviating congestion. ⏮️
2️⃣  Propagation of congestion: Congestion information is propagated back through the network, affecting nodes in the opposite direction of the data flow. 🔄
3️⃣  Choke Packet Technique: Sending choke packets to inform the source of congestion and adjust its transmission rate accordingly. 🚥
4️⃣  Monitoring resource utilization: Constantly monitoring resource usage and providing feedback to nodes to reduce unnecessary traffic. 📊
5️⃣  Implicit Signaling: Predicting congestion based on lack of acknowledgments and adjusting transmission rates accordingly without explicit communication with congested nodes. 🤝
6️⃣  Explicit Signaling: Sending explicit packets to inform about congestion, using forward and backward signaling to manage congestion effectively. 📡

P.S.  Network congestion doesn't have to be a mystery! Understanding these concepts can help you create smoother, more efficient network experiences.
