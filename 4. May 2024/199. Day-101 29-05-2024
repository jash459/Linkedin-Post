Ever wondered why Istio exists and how it fits into the microservices landscape? 🤔 Let's unravel this puzzle together! 🕵️‍♀️

Microservices, Kubernetes, and Istio are like layers of a tech stack, each solving a unique set of problems. 🤯

✪ Why Is There an Istio?
1️⃣  Microservices as a technical solution to an organizational problem 😎
2️⃣  Kubernetes/Istio as a technical solution for issues created by moving to microservices 🤔
3️⃣  Containers as a deliverable for microservices, solving the problem of environmental consistency and allowing for more granularity in limiting application resources 📦
4️⃣  Kubernetes as a container scheduling tool to address deployment and scheduling problems of distributed applications 📅
5️⃣  Elasticity of computing resources and the need for managing traffic post-deployment 🚀

✪ How Do You Do Service Management in Kubernetes?
1️⃣  Service model in Kubernetes, including scheduling, traffic forwarding, and external service unification 🛠️
2️⃣  Kubernetes as a tool for intensive resource management 🔧
3️⃣  Challenges remaining after resource allocation, such as robustness, redundancy, traffic division, security, and multi-cluster management 🛡️

✪ The Basics of Istio
1️⃣  Service model in Istio with Istiod as the control plane and sidecar proxies for traffic management 🧩
2️⃣  Intelligent application-aware load balancing in Istio, bypassing kube-proxy load balancing ⚖️
3️⃣  Declarative API for traffic management manipulation, similar to workload management in Kubernetes 📜
4️⃣  Replacement of Ingress with Gateway resources and inclusion of virtual machines in the Istio mesh 🛤️
5️⃣  Transparent traffic management in Istio, complementing Kubernetes for enhanced traffic management, observability, and security 🔍
