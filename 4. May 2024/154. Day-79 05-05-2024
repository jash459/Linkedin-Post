Ever waited forever for a website to load? That frustrating slowdown is likely network congestion! Let's break it down... 💥

Network Congestion and Congestion Control Algorithms:

✪ Definition of Congestion:
1️⃣  Occurs when message traffic overwhelms network capacity. 🚦
2️⃣  Slows down network response time. ⏳
#networkcongestion

✪ Effects of Congestion:
1️⃣  Increased delay reduces performance. 📉
2️⃣  Retransmission occurs as delays increase, worsening the situation. 🔁
#congestioneffects

✪ Congestion Control Algorithms:
1️⃣  Mechanism regulating data packets' entry into the network. 🔄
2️⃣  Enables better utilization of shared network infrastructure. 💡

✪ Congestive-Avoidance Algorithms (CAA):
1️⃣  Implemented at the TCP layer to prevent congestive collapse. 🚧

✪ Leaky Bucket Algorithm:
1️⃣  Controls traffic rate to the network for shaping purposes. 🚰
2️⃣  Converts burst traffic into steady streams. 🌊
3️⃣  Inefficient resource utilization due to constant output design. ⚙️
#leakybucket

✪ Token Bucket Algorithm:
1️⃣  More flexible than the leaky bucket for handling bursty traffic. 🪣
2️⃣  Based on token generation, defines flow transmission orders. 📑
#tokenbucket

✪ Advantages of Token Bucket over Leaky Bucket:
1️⃣  Introduces flexibility in packet transmission rate. 🔄
2️⃣  Tokens generated at regular intervals for more adaptive traffic handling. 🕰️
#tokenadvantages

✪ Ways Token Bucket is Superior:
1️⃣  Allows for greater flexibility compared to the conservative nature of the leaky bucket. 🔄
2️⃣  Generates tokens at intervals, enabling transmissions at varying rates based on availability. 🔄

✪ Formula for Token Bucket Algorithm:
1️⃣  S is the time taken. ⏰
2️⃣  M is the maximum output rate. 📈
3️⃣  ? is the token arrival rate. ➕
#tokenformula

✪ Usefulness of Token Bucket Algorithm:
1️⃣  Combats packet loss by handling bursty traffic more efficiently. 💪
2️⃣  Offers more flexibility in managing network traffic flow. 🌐
