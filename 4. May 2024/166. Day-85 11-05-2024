India's ITeS growth is stalling...and that's a BIG concern! 📉

This sector is a massive economic engine for India – we can't afford a slowdown. 💪🇮🇳

→ Growth plummeted from 8.4% to 3.9% – that's no small dip! 🚩
→ Remember the post-dot com boom? India became an IT superpower... 🚀
→ But the world's changing...what's behind the drop? 🤔 

1️⃣ Western economies slowing down = less IT spending
2️⃣ Geopolitical tensions = lower demand for our services 3️⃣ Nations getting self-reliant + diversifying tech sources
4️⃣ Rise of Gen AI = less need for some outsourcing 🤖

CTA:  India's resilient, but needs a strategy. How do we stay the IT leader? 🧠

PS:  Upskilling + tech investment seem like the way forward...💡
