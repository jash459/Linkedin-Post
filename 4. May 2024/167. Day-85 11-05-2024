Ever wonder how your message finds its way across the internet? 🤔 It's like having a digital traffic cop and translator all in one!

Let's break down the power players of networking: routers and gateways.

✪ Router:
1️⃣  Hardware responsible for receiving, analyzing, and forwarding data packets to other networks. 🔄
2️⃣  Supports dynamic routing. 🛤️
3️⃣  Main function is to route traffic from one network to another. 🚥
4️⃣  Operates on layer 3 and layer 4 of the OSI model. 💻
5️⃣  Installs routing details for multiple networks and routes traffic based on destination address. 📶

✪ Gateway:
1️⃣  Device used for communication among networks with different protocols. 📡
2️⃣  Does not support dynamic routing. 🚫
3️⃣  Main function is to translate one protocol to another. 🔀
4️⃣  Operates up to layer 5 of the OSI model. 🧩
5️⃣  Differentiates what is inside and outside the network. 🧭
