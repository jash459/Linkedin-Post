Ready to level up your networking game? 📶 Here's your crash course on switching!

✪ Definition:
1️⃣ Switching is the process of transferring data packets from one device to another in a network using devices called switches. 🔄
2️⃣ Takes place at the Data Link layer of the OSI Model. 🛠️
hashtag#Switching

✪ Functionality:
1️⃣ Network Switch: Dedicated hardware facilitating data packet transfer to their destination. 🖥️
2️⃣ Works at Data Link layer. 🔗
3️⃣ Determines data packets' paths using MAC Addresses. 📡
4️⃣ Maintains a Switching Table for efficient data routing. 📊

✪ Process:
1️⃣ Frame Reception: Receives data packets. 📶
2️⃣ MAC Address Extraction: Retrieves destination MAC Address. 🕵️
3️⃣ MAC Address Table Lookup: Matches MAC Address in switching table. 🔍
4️⃣ Forwarding Decision: Forwards data based on MAC Address. 🚀
5️⃣ Frame Transition: Sends data to destination port. 📤

✪ Types of Switching:
1️⃣ Message Switching: Older technique, forwarding entire message across the network making it inefficient. 📫
2️⃣ Circuit Switching:Establishes a connection beforehand, utilizing complete bandwidth until data transfer completion and more efficient than message switching as data is sent directly to its destination. 🎯
3️⃣ Packet Switching: Data broken into packets, transferred based on network resources and widely used in modern computers and the Internet. 🌐

✪ Datagram Packet Switching:
1️⃣ Processes each data frame individually without prior connection establishment. 📄
2️⃣ Provides flexibility but may result in data loss. 🚫

✪. Virtual-Circuit Packet Switching:
1️⃣ Establishes logical connections (virtual circuits) before data transmission. 🔄
2️⃣ Ensures reliable data transfer with reduced data loss. ✅
