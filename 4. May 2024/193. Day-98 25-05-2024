Kubernetes enthusiasts, ever found yourself tangled in the complex web of deploying extension API servers? 🕸️ 

Let's untangle this together and streamline your Kubernetes experience! 🚀

✪ Ensure APIService API is Enabled:
1️⃣  Check --runtime-config for APIService API enablement. 🛠️
2️⃣  Should be on by default; can be manually enabled if necessary. 🔄  
#APIService

✪ Implement RBAC Rules:
1️⃣  Create an RBAC rule for adding APIService objects. 📝
2️⃣  Obtain permissions from the cluster administrator if needed. 🛡️  
#RBAC

✪ Namespace Configuration:
1️⃣  Create the Kubernetes namespace for the extension API service deployment. 📂  
#NamespaceConfiguration

✪ Certificate Management:
1️⃣  Obtain a CA cert for signing the server cert. 🔏
2️⃣  Generate a server cert/key for HTTPS, signed by the CA. 🔐
3️⃣  Ensure the server cert has the correct CN derived from the Kubernetes service. 🛡️  
#CertificateManagement

✪ Secret Management:
1️⃣  Create a Kubernetes secret containing the server cert/key. 🗝️  
#SecretManagement

✪ Deployment Setup:
1️⃣  Create a Kubernetes deployment for the extension API server, loading the secret as a volume. 📦
2️⃣  Reference a working image for the extension API server. 🖼️  
#DeploymentSetup

✪ TLS Configuration:
1️⃣  Verify that the API server loads the certs from the volume and uses them in the HTTPS handshake. 🤝  
#TLSConfiguration

✪ Service Account Creation:
1️⃣  Create a Kubernetes service account in the target namespace. 🧑‍💻  
#ServiceAccount

✪ Cluster Role Configuration:
1️⃣  Define a Kubernetes cluster role for the desired resource operations. 📜  
#ClusterRole

✪ Role Binding and Auth Delegation:
1️⃣  Create cluster role bindings between the service account and the defined cluster roles. 🔗
2️⃣  Establish a role binding for auth delegation to system:auth-delegator. 🛡️  
#RoleBinding

✪ Authentication Configuration:
1️⃣  Create a role binding for the service account to access extension-apiserver-authentication configmap. 🔑  
#Authentication

✪ APIService Creation:
1️⃣  Create a Kubernetes APIService with the base64-encoded CA cert for spec.caBundle. 🏷️
2️⃣  Ensure the API aggregation with kube-aggregator API uses PEM-encoded CA bundle. 📦  
#APIServiceCreation

✪ Validation and Testing:
1️⃣  Verify setup by using kubectl to check for the new resource. ✔️  
#ValidationTesting
