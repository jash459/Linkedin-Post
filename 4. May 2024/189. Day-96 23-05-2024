A Wake-Up Call for Justice in Pune 💔

This isn't just a car accident. Two promising lives – Ashwini and Anish – were stolen. A 17-year-old, allegedly intoxicated and driving an unregistered Porsche, caused the fatal crash. One died instantly; the other fought, but lost the battle.

And yet, within 15 hours, the minor was granted bail.

This isn't justice. This is a system failing us all.

✪ What Went Wrong?

→ Unregistered vehicle: The Porsche was unregistered.
→ Underage, unlicensed driver: The 17-year-old had no legal right to be behind the wheel.
→ Alcohol served to a minor: The club broke the law.
→ Police negligence?: An unregistered, speeding car seemingly went unnoticed.

✪ A Twisted Tale of Privilege

The swiftness of the bail, the conditions... it all reeks of privilege. While ordinary citizens struggle for basic legal aid, this minor had immediate support. A 300-word essay, painting signs, and working with a constable for two weeks? 

Are these the consequences for ending two lives?

Pune police's actions add insult to injury. Instead of comforting grieving families, they pry into the victims' personal lives. Where is the empathy? Where is the justice?

We Demand Better 📢 
Ashwini and Anish deserved better. Their families deserve justice. We cannot allow a system to value privilege over accountability. We cannot remain silent.

✪ What Can You Do?

→ Share this post: Spread awareness. Let's make this a national conversation.
→ Demand a retrial: This case needs a fair and thorough re-examination.
→ Advocate for stricter laws: We need stricter laws against underage drinking and reckless driving.
→ Support the families: Let's show them they are not alone.
→ This isn't just about Pune. This is about the kind of country we want to live in. A country where justice is truly served, for everyone. ⚖

P.S.: I've read the reports. I've seen the pain in the families' eyes. I'm heartbroken, and I'm angry. But most of all, I'm determined to see justice done. 🙏
