Ever wondered how your favorite apps send and receive data so seamlessly? 🤔

The answer lies in the magic of the Transport Layer Protocol! ✨  Let's dive into its inner workings...

✪ Functions of Transport Layer Protocol:

1️⃣   Your data's personal delivery service. 🚚
2️⃣   The connection that keeps everything flowing. 🔗
3️⃣   Multitasking maestro for smooth communication. 🔄
4️⃣   Your data's bodyguard against transmission errors. ✅
5️⃣   The traffic cop of data flow. 🚦
6️⃣   Ensures your data doesn't get overwhelmed. 💧

✪ Characteristics of Transport Layer Protocol:

1️⃣   Reliability vs. speed – TCP or UDP, the choice is yours! 🔄
2️⃣   Data parcels for efficient delivery. 📦
3️⃣   The party line for multiple applications. 👥
4️⃣   Direct to the source with port numbers. 📡

✪ Transport Layer Protocols

→  UDP (User Datagram Protocol):

1️⃣   The express lane of data transmission. 🔀
2️⃣   No handshakes, just fast delivery. 🔄
3️⃣   Perfect for when speed is key. 📧

→  TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):

1️⃣   Your data's secure connection. 🔗
2️⃣   Reliability is the name of the game. 🔒
3️⃣   Every byte counts with ordered delivery. 📊
4️⃣   Lost packets? Not on TCP's watch! ❌

→  SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol):

1️⃣   Two-way communication at its finest. 🔗
2️⃣   One-to-one connections for focused data exchange. 📡
3️⃣   Reliability and flexibility for demanding applications. 🏠
4️⃣   A more specialized tool for specific needs. 🔄
