DNS: The Internet's Phonebook – How Does It Work? 🤔🔍

Ever wondered how your browser finds websites when you type in a name? It's all thanks to DNS! Let's unravel this internet magic together.✨

Here's the step-by-step journey:

✪ Steps in a DNS Lookup:

1️⃣  User types the domain name into a web browser. 🌐
2️⃣  Query reaches a DNS recursive resolver. 🔄
3️⃣  Resolver queries a DNS root nameserver. 🌍
4️⃣  Root server directs the resolver to a Top Level Domain (TLD) server. 🌐
5️⃣  Resolver requests information from the TLD server. 📄
6️⃣  TLD server provides the IP address of the domain's nameserver. 🏢
7️⃣  Resolver queries the domain's nameserver. 💻
8️⃣  Nameserver returns the IP address to the resolver. 📲

✪ DNS Resolver:

1️⃣  Acts as the first point in DNS lookup. 🔍
2️⃣  Handles the client request and initiates DNS queries. 📡
3️⃣  Manages both recursive and iterative queries for DNS resolution. 🔄

✪ Types of DNS Queries:

1️⃣  Recursive Query: Client requests a DNS server (resolver) to respond with a resource record or an error message. 📨
2️⃣  Iterative Query: DNS server returns the best answer; if no match, it provides a referral to an authoritative server. 🔗
3️⃣  Non-Recursive Query: Query for a record already cached or in the authoritative server's records, reducing bandwidth and load. 📉

✪ DNS Caching and Locations:

→  Purpose: Temporarily store data for performance and reliability improvement. ⚡
→  Browser DNS Caching:
1️⃣  Modern browsers cache DNS for quicker resolution. 🌐
2️⃣  DNS cache in browsers checked first for requested records. 🔍
→  Operating System Level DNS Caching:
1️⃣  Stub resolver on the OS level. 🖥️
2️⃣  Queries local cache before reaching ISP's DNS recursive resolver. 📡
3️⃣  Recursive resolver checks local cache and queries authoritative nameservers. 🌍
