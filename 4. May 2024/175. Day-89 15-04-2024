Ever feel like your Kubernetes controllers are juggling too many tasks? 🤹‍♀️

Let's streamline those controllers for efficiency and ease of management!

✪ Handle Resources Marked for Deletion:

1️⃣  DeletionTimestamp indicates when a resource will be deleted; handling this properly is crucial. 👌
2️⃣  Use IsZero() method or check for nil to handle deletion appropriately. 💡
#DeletionManagement

✪ Filter Reconciliation Triggering Events:

1️⃣  Controllers reconcile resource states based on events triggered by spec or status changes. 🔄
2️⃣  Event filters with predicates help in screening out specific events to optimize reconciliation. 🕵️‍♂️
#EventFiltering

✪ Bind Resources Through Ownership:

1️⃣  Connect parent and child objects in Kubernetes by setting owner references. 🔗
2️⃣  Ensure parent-child relationships to manage resources efficiently and avoid resource build-up. 🏗️
#ResourceBinding

✪ Check for 3rd Party Resource Definitions:

1️⃣  Verify the presence of necessary components (e.g., Prometheus) for a controller's functionality. ✔️
2️⃣  Use the provided APIs to check for Custom Resource Definitions like ServiceMonitors. 📋
#ResourceVerification

✪ Record Events:

1️⃣  Utilize EventRecorder to log Kubernetes events triggered by object changes in a cluster. 📝
2️⃣  Customize event recording based on controller functionality needs. 🎚️
#EventRecording

✪ Get Kubernetes Clientset Instance:

1️⃣  Create a Kubernetes Clientset instance by first obtaining a *rest.Config and using it to initialize the clientset. 🛠️
#ClientInitialization

✪ Check if You're Running on Openshift:

1️⃣  Use the discovery package to detect specific API groups (e.g., route.openshift.io) to ascertain if running on OpenShift. 🚦
#PlatformDetection

✪ Create Objects from Templates:

1️⃣  Create Kubernetes objects using manifest templates with placeholders for dynamic data injection. 📄
2️⃣  Read templates, fill placeholders, and deserialize YAML templates to create Kubernetes objects effectively. 🔄
#ObjectCreation
