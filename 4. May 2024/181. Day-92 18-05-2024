Ever wondered how your computer says "hello" to a website? 🤔 It's not magic, it's the TCP 3-Way Handshake! 🤝

I recently deepened my networking knowledge, and this connection process fascinates me. 

Here's the breakdown:

→ Step 1 (SYN):
1️⃣  Client initiates the connection by sending a segment with SYN (Synchronize Sequence Number) to the server. 🚀
2️⃣  Indicates the client's intention to start communication and the sequence number it will use for segments. 🔒
3️⃣  The client includes other TCP control information, such as window size and maximum segment size, in the segment. 💡
#tcp

→ Step 2 (SYN + ACK):
1️⃣  Server responds to the client with SYN-ACK signal bits set. 🔄
2️⃣  The ACK signifies the acknowledgment of the segment received, and SYN indicates the sequence number the server will use for segments. 📡
3️⃣  The server also includes TCP control information in the response, like window size and maximum segment size. 📈
#handshake

→ Step 3 (ACK):
1️⃣  The client acknowledges the server's response, establishing a reliable connection for actual data transfer. ✅
2️⃣  Once the connection is established, both client and server can start sending data segments using the sequence numbers established during the handshake. 📩
3️⃣  TCP uses the acknowledgment mechanism to ensure reliable data transfer, retransmitting any unacknowledged segments. 🔄

PS:  The TCP 3-Way Handshake is the foundation of reliable internet connections –  it's like the polite introduction before the real conversation begins. 😉
