Ever wonder what happens when your internet connection goes wonky? 🤔 Chances are, ICMP is behind the scenes!

ICMP: Your Network's Error-Reporting Powerhouse ⚡️

✪ Purpose and Usage:
1️⃣  ICMP is used as an error-reporting protocol by network devices such as routers. 🔄
2️⃣  It generates error messages to the source IP address when network problems prevent the delivery of IP packets. 🚨
3️⃣  It is used for network diagnostics, including utilities like ping and traceroute. 🔍

✪ Functionality:
1️⃣  ICMP is a network layer protocol used by routers, intermediary devices, and hosts to communicate error information or updates to other devices and hosts. 📡
2️⃣  It is used in scenarios like a message being too large for the recipient to process, redirection to a shorter route, and network diagnosis. 🔄

✪ Operation:
1️⃣  ICMP is not a transport protocol for sending data between systems, but it is essential for troubleshooting internet connections. 🌐
2️⃣  It operates as a part of the IP suite and is a connectionless protocol, not associated with any transport layer protocol like TCP or UDP. 🔄 
#troubleshooting

✪ Message Structure:
1️⃣  ICMP messages contain parameters such as type, code, and checksum, which help identify errors in IP packets. 📝
2️⃣  The message structure also includes a pointer to identify the problem in the original IP message and the original datagram. 📌

✪ DDoS Attacks:
1️⃣  ICMP can be exploited in DDoS attacks through methods like the ping of death, ICMP flood attacks, and Smurf attacks. ⚔️
2️⃣  These attacks aim to overwhelm the target with unwanted traffic and cause denial of service. ⛔
