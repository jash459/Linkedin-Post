Ever wondered how to extend Kubernetes beyond its built-in capabilities? 🤔 

Well, the answer lies in Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)! 🚀

✪ What are CRDs?
1️⃣  CRDs allow the creation of custom API objects and define new types, extending Kubernetes' capabilities beyond built-in resources like Pods and Deployments. 🔄
2️⃣  They enable the incorporation of any API object useful for applications. 🔧
#customobjects

✪ Why CRDs?
1️⃣  CRDs extend the Kubernetes API and provide the ability to manage more than just containers. 🚀
2️⃣  When used with Kubernetes operators, CRDs offer nearly limitless possibilities to manage various components of infrastructure. 💡
#managecomponents

✪ How to create a CRD?
1️⃣  Use the Kubernetes API Server to create a new RESTful resource path for each specified version when creating a new CRD. 🛠️
2️⃣  A manifest file defines the CRD, and it needs to be applied using 'kubectl apply -f' command. 📋 
#applymanifest

✪ Create custom objects
1️⃣  Custom objects can be created after the CustomResourceDefinition object has been created using a manifest file. 🌐
2️⃣  Custom fields can be added to custom objects, and these fields may contain any JSON. 💬 
#customfields

✪ How to delete a CRD?
1️⃣  Removing a CustomResourceDefinition removes the RESTful API endpoint and all custom objects stored in it. ❌ 
#deleteCRD

✪ CRD vs ConfigMap
1️⃣  CRDs serve to create specialized automation and expand the Kubernetes API, while ConfigMaps are intended for configuring pods. 🔄 
#specializedautomation

✪ Conclusion
1️⃣  CRDs offer flexibility in creating custom Kubernetes objects, opening up numerous possibilities for usage. 🌟
