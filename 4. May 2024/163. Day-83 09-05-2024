Ever wondered how those big data packets magically shrink to fit different networks? 🤔

It's all about fragmentation! 📦

✪ Fragmentation Definition and Process:
1️⃣  Fragmentation is a technique in which gateways break up larger packets into smaller ones called fragments.🔍
2️⃣  Each fragment is sent as a separate internal packet and has its separate header and trailer.🛠️

✪ Reassembly of Fragments:
1️⃣  Reassembling of fragments is usually done by the destination host because each fragment becomes an independent datagram.🔨
2️⃣  Datagram can be fragmented several times before reaching the final destination.🔄

✪ Strategies for Recombination:
→  Transparent Fragmentation:
1️⃣  One network is made transparent to all other subsequent networks through which the packet will pass.🔗
2️⃣  Gateway breaks a packet into smaller fragments, and the exit gateway recombines all fragments before passing them to the subsequent network.🔀

→  Non-Transparent Fragmentation:
1️⃣  One network is non-transparent to the subsequent networks through which a packet passes.🚫
2️⃣  Fragmented packet is not recombined by the exit gateway of the same network, and recombination of fragments is done at the destination host.🔚

✪ Advantages and Disadvantages:
→  Transparent Fragmentation Advantages:
1️⃣  Subsequent network is not aware that fragmentation has occurred.🌐
2️⃣ Used by ATM networks.💳

→  Transparent Fragmentation Disadvantages:
1️⃣  Exit fragment in a network must know when it has received all fragments.⏳
2️⃣  Adds considerable overhead in repeatedly fragmenting and reassembling large packets.📈

→  Non-Transparent Fragmentation Advantages:
1️⃣  Can use multiple exit gateways and improve network performance.🚀
2️⃣  Higher throughput.🚄

→  Non-Transparent Fragmentation Disadvantages:
1️⃣  Every host has the capability of reassembling fragments.🔧
2️⃣  Total overhead increases due to fragmentation as each fragment must have its own header.💡
