Ever wondered how your internet packets find their way so quickly? 🤔  Let's dive into the world of distance vector routing...

✪ Distance Vector Routing Protocol:
1️⃣  Uses the Bellman-Ford algorithm to find the shortest path between routers. 🛤️
2️⃣  Acquires information from neighboring routers to reach destinations. 🔄
#Distance 

✪ Count to Infinity Problem:
1️⃣  Occurs due to routing loops where routers send updates simultaneously or if interfaces go down. ⭕
2️⃣  Leads to looping packets, delays, and network failures. ⏳
#Count

✪ Route Poisoning:
1️⃣  Solution to prevent routing loops. 🚫
2️⃣  Updates broken interface distances to infinity; failed paths are considered poisoned. 🔀
3️⃣  Stops sending distance vectors to neighbors if a metric value is infinity. ⛔
#Route Poisoning

✪ Split Horizon:
1️⃣  Another method to prevent routing loops in distance vector protocols. 🔄
2️⃣  Ensures routing information is not sent back in the direction from which it was received. 🚷
#Split Horizon

✪ Conclusion:
1️⃣  Count to Infinity Problem arises due to routing inefficiencies in Distance Vector Routing. ⚠️
2️⃣  Methods like Route Poisoning and Split Horizon help mitigate this issue. ✅
