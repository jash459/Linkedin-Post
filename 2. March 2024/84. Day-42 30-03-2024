Ever wondered how much your website can handle? Or why that video call keeps dropping? That's where throughput comes in! 💡

Let's break down throughput, the secret superpower of tech: 🦸‍♀️

✪ What is Throughput?
1️⃣ Throughput refers to the rate at which a system, process, or network can transfer data or perform operations in a given period, often measured in bits per second (bps) or transactions per second. It is calculated by the number of operations/items processed divided by the time taken. 📈
