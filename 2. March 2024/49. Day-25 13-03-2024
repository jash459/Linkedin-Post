Streamline Your React Development with Docker Hot Reloading! 🎯   



Tired of constant restarts during React development? Docker can be your hero! 💪

This post unveils the secrets to enabling hot reloading in your React projects within Docker containers. 📦



1️⃣  Create a React App (they see me rollin', they hatin') 🎶

→ Use npx create-react-app to set up a basic React application. Let's call it reactapp. 💻

#docker #hotreloading



2️⃣  Craft Your Dockerfile (the blueprint for your container) 📝

● Dockerfile



# Base image: Node.js

→ FROM node:14.21.1-alpine 



# Working directory

→ WORKDIR /app



# Environment variables

→ ENV PATH /app/node_modules/.bin:$PATH



# Copy essential files

→ COPY package.json ./

→ COPY package-lock.json ./



# Install dependencies silently

→ RUN npm install --silent

→ RUN npm install react-scripts@5.0.1 -g --silent



# Hot reloading with nodemon

→ RUN npm install nodemon --save-dev

→ COPY . ./



# Start with nodemon

→ CMD ["nodemon", "--exec", "npm", "start"] ✨

#reactjs  #dockerfile



3️⃣  Don't Forget the .dockerignore File (keep things tidy) 🧹

→ node_modules

→ build

→ .dockerignore

→ Dockerfile

→ Dockerfile.prod

#dockerfile #docker



4️⃣ Build Your Docker Image (let's get this ship sailing!) 🚢

→ docker build -t react_img .

#docker #dockerimage



5️⃣  Create a Container (time to set sail!) 🐳

→ Bash

→ docker run -it --name react_container_app -p 3000:3000 react_img

#docker #dockercontainers 



●  Hot Reloading Magic! ✨

→ There are two ways to experience the hot reloading goodness:



1️⃣  Inside the Container 

→ Jump in using docker exec -it react_container_app sh. 

→ Navigate to cd src/ and edit App.js. 

→ Save the changes. Boom! The web app reflects the modifications instantly. 🎉



2️⃣  Outside the Container (volume mounting for the win!) 🥇

→ Create a new container with volume mounting:

➡ docker run -it --name new_react_container --volume ./reactapp/:/app/ -p 3000:3000 react_img 

→ Modify the code in your host directory (/reactapp/src). 

→ Witness the magic! The web app updates automatically. 💫

Now you can develop React applications in Docker containers with the power of hot reloading! ⚡️



P.S. This approach streamlines your development workflow and saves precious time. ⏳
