Unlocking the Secrets of Caches: Write Policies & Allocation Decisions 📝

Caches are the hidden heroes of computing, speeding things up by keeping frequently accessed data readily available. But caches come with their own set of decisions to be made, especially when it comes to writing data. 🤔

Here's a quick breakdown to boost your cache knowledge: 🧠

1️⃣ Caches:
● A cache provides faster access to some storage, improving latency and throughput. 🚀
● It can be at hardware or software levels and has cache hits and misses, as well as eviction and invalidation processes. 💾
● Eviction removes data from the cache, while invalidation marks cache entries as invalid and readies them for refreshing from the backing store. 🔄 #datastorage #performance #hardware #software

2️⃣ Write Policy:
● A cache's write policy determines its behavior during write operations, affecting various characteristics. 💡
● Three common policies are write-through, write-around, and write-back. 🔄
● Write-through ensures consistency by updating the backing store before responding, while write-around avoids cache pollution, and write-back allows for a faster response with asynchronous backing store updates. 📝

3️⃣ Write Allocation Decision:
● Write allocation decisions include write allocate (fetch-on-write) and no-write allocate (no-fetch-on-write), impacting cache population and backing store operations. 📊
● Fetch-on-write is usually paired with write-back, while no-fetch-on-write is applied more often to write-through. 🔄

4️⃣ Understanding Tradeoffs:
● The choice of write policy and allocation decision depends on the need for consistency or high performance in write operations. ⚖️
● It is influenced by cache access patterns in terms of read/write frequency and data locality. 📊

5️⃣ Conclusion:
● The post explored various write policies used in caches, highlighting the need to consider specific requirements, access patterns, and available resources when choosing a policy. 🧠
