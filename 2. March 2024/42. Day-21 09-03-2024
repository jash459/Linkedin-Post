📦 What Content Can a CDN Deliver? 

1️⃣ Static Content: Unchanging website elements like logos and images, perfect for CDN storage. 🖼️ 
2️⃣ Dynamic Content: Content that varies per user (e.g., social media feeds). CDNs optimize connections for faster delivery. 🔄

⚙️ How Does a CDN Work? CDNs utilize a network of edge servers strategically placed around the globe. Here's the magic: ✨

1️⃣ Caching: Frequently accessed content is stored on nearby edge servers for ultra-fast retrieval. 💾
2️⃣ Dynamic Acceleration: For dynamic content, CDNs optimize connections between users and origin servers, reducing delays. 💫
3️⃣ Edge Logic Computations: CDNs can perform computations at the edge to simplify communication and improve performance. 🧠
