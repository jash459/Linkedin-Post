🤔 Are your container images bloated AND vulnerable? Time to slim down and lock them up!

👩‍💻Content Detailed:

Shrink that footprint: Smaller images = faster builds, deployments, and reduced network strain 🚀
1️⃣ Base image matters: Choose lightweight base images (e.g., Alpine variants) tailored to your application's needs.🌱
2️⃣ Layer optimization: Combine multiple commands in a single RUN statement (using '&&') to reduce image layers.🛠️
3️⃣ Clean as you go: Remove unnecessary packages, temporary files, and caches within the same layer.🧹

💪 Security is non-negotiable: Keep images patched and protected 💪

1️⃣ Update your base: Rebuild images regularly to incorporate the latest security patches in the base image.🔒
2️⃣ Minimize privileges: Avoid running containers as root; create a dedicated, non-root user for your application.👨‍💻
3️⃣ Be selective: Carefully consider what you COPY or ADD to the image; avoid including sensitive data.🛡️

👇 Additional Tips:

1️⃣ Leverage distroless images: Consider distroless images for even smaller footprints and reduced attack surfaces.🐧
2️⃣ Sign your images: Use image signing and verification to ensure the integrity and origin of your images.🔏
