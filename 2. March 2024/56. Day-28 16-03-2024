Ready to ditch that clunky, slow monolith? Time to explore the power of microservices! 🚀 

😉 Microservice Migration: A Step-by-Step Guide :

Step 1: Assess Your Readiness :
1️⃣ Core business goals: Define what you aim to achieve with microservices.🚀
2️⃣ SLAs: Ensure your service-level agreements align with the infrastructure and, if necessary, the SLAs offered by cloud providers 🤝

Step 7: Design Communication Strategies
1️⃣ Synchronous vs. Asynchronous: Prioritize asynchronous communication as your architecture scales. ↔️
2️⃣ Public and Backend APIs: Define API types for client-facing interactions and inter-microservice communication. 💻
