5️⃣ The building blocks to Deploy Containers: Let's break it down...
→ Dockerfile: Your blueprint for success.  Briefly touch on best practices for writing efficient Dockerfiles (e.g., multi-stage builds).
→ Image build: Time to create the magic. ✨  Mention the importance of image optimization techniques to reduce image size and improve performance.
→ Registry push: Sharing your masterpiece with the world. 🌎  Discuss the difference between public registries (Docker Hub) and the need for private registries for sensitive applications.
→ Container launch: Showtime! 🎉 Explain various deployment options (single host, clusters, cloud providers) and their suitability.
→ Management and monitoring: Keep a watchful eye for optimal performance 👀  Recommend popular monitoring and logging tools for containers (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack).
