Ever wondered how your favorite apps get those real-time updates? 🤔 It's all about push and pull architectures. Learn how push and pull architectures can streamline your applications.

✪ Push and Pull Architecture: 
1️⃣  The push and pull architecture of network communications plays a significant role in managing traffic and server load. 🚦
2️⃣  Push architecture, such as websocket, allows data to be pushed upstream as soon as it becomes available. 🌊

✪ Pull API Architecture: 
1️⃣  In pull architecture, the client initiates communication by requesting updates from the server. 📥
2️⃣  Polling updates in pull architecture can slow down or overload the server, making push architecture a better choice for frequent updates. ⚙️
 #pull

✪ Push API Architecture: 
1️⃣  Push APIs allow the server to send updates to the client whenever new data becomes available without the need for explicit requests. 📩
2️⃣  Push architecture is more efficient for time-sensitive data that changes often. ⏱️

✪ Pull vs Push APIs: 
1️⃣  In pull API, the client requests information, while in push API, the server sends information as it becomes available. 🔄
2️⃣  Push APIs are event-driven and significantly faster than pull APIs. ⚡

✪ Why Push APIs?:
1️⃣  Push APIs minimize server load and are particularly useful for real-time applications with frequent data exchanges. 🔄
2️⃣  They enable parallel workflows in an application system and reduce traffic, leading to a more stable and cost-effective system. 🚀

✪ Use Cases for Push APIs:
1️⃣  Push APIs eliminate constant update requests, making them suitable for delivering system updates efficiently. 🔄
2️⃣  In complex routing systems, push architecture simplifies the communication process and is a viable option. 🧩

✪ Push APIs In Advanced Network Architectures: 
1️⃣  Push APIs are common in event-driven and pub/sub architectures, and are used at the heart of the WebSockets architecture. 🔄
2️⃣  They are crucial in triggering communication and actions across different services in microservices-based systems. 🔄
