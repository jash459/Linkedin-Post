Progress, or a threat to our jobs? The AI coding revolution is here....

üåêüíª Hey coders, hold onto your keyboards! A startup just dropped Devin, the world's first AI software engineer, and it's not your grandma's coding assistant.

‚óè This thing is legit!

1Ô∏è‚É£ Devin builds entire apps - Say goodbye to coding marathons! Devin creates complete applications all by itself.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Real-world tested - They threw actual Upwork jobs at Devin, and guess what? It crushed them! Upwork devs, you might want to brush up your skills.
3Ô∏è‚É£ GitHub whisperer - Devin tackled a whopping 14% of open-source project issues on GitHub - better than many human devs! (Mic drop. )

‚óè Industry leaders are freaking out (in a good way):

1Ô∏è‚É£ The single most impressive demo I've seen in a decade!" - Eric Glyman, Cofounder of multi-billion dollar startup Ramp.
2Ô∏è‚É£ This AI agent seems to be superhuman!" - CEO of Perplexity. (See what I did there? )

‚ô¶ This, my friends, is a glimpse into the future of coding. Want to learn more about Devin and explore other mind-blowing AI tools?

‚ô¶ The AI revolution is here, and it's gonna be wild. Buckle up! Stay ahead of the curve and unlock the power of AI for yourself.

‚ú™ P.S.Think AI writing apps is science fiction? Think again! Devin is just the beginning. Ô∏è
