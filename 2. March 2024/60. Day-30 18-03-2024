Ever wondered how apps talk to each other?

APIs are the secret messengers that make it happen! But designing a good API can be tricky. Here's a breakdown to get you started:📋

1️⃣  Think names carefully! Don't call your API "GetUsers" if it only retrieves specific user data. Descriptive names like "GetUserById" are much clearer for everyone. 👍
#APInaming #clarity 

2️⃣  Parameters: when you need them  Not all APIs need extra parameters. But for filtering or tracking, URL query strings or body parameters can be helpful. 🔎
#APIparameters #filtering 

3️⃣  Response objects: keep it clean Only return what's needed! Don't overload responses with unnecessary information. A clear structure with title, subject, and relevant categories is key. 🎯 
#APIresponse #datastructure

4️⃣  Error messages: be specific! Generic errors like "Error Found" are frustrating. Explain what went wrong and how to fix it. 🔧
#APIerrors #debugging 

5️⃣  HTTP methods matter! Use the right methods for different actions:
→ GET: Retrieve data 📥
→ POST: Send data 📤
→ PUT: Update data ✏️
→ PATCH: Modify specific parts of data 🩹 
→ DELETE: Remove data 🗑️

6️⃣  Routing for clarity Make it easy for users to find the API they need. Clear and consistent routing is essential. 🗺️
#APIrouting #discoverability 

7️⃣  Avoid side effects! An API call for a user's first name shouldn't return their entire profile! 🤐 
#APIscope #dataintegrity 

8️⃣  Pagination for large data sets For massive datasets, pagination breaks down responses into smaller chunks, making them faster and easier to handle. 📖 
#pagination #largedata 

9️⃣  Fragmentation: when big is too big For internal communication, fragmentation can handle exceptionally large responses by sending them in manageable bits. 🧩

Bonus tip: Caching for efficiency ⚡️ Caching frequently requested data reduces database load and improves response times. 🚀
