Tired of slow systems lagging behind you? 🤔 Ever waited for screens to load, or games to respond? That's latency at work! 🐌

Understanding Latency: Factors, Measurement, and Impact on Applications and Systems

✪ Latency meaning: 
1️⃣ Latency refers to the time it takes for a request to travel from its point of origin to its destination and receive a response. 🚀
2️⃣ It involves various factors such as processing time, network travel time, and queueing time, and can be measured in seconds, milliseconds, or nanoseconds. 📏

✪ How does Latency work?: 🛠️
1️⃣ Latency occurs due to the time taken for transmitting an action, server processing, transmitting the response, and updating the screen. ⏳
2️⃣ High latency can cause delays in real-time applications, such as online gaming, resulting in shot registration delays and inconsistencies. 🎮 hashtag#functionality

✪ What is Network Latency?: 🌐
1️⃣ Network Latency is the time it takes for data to travel from one point in a network to another and is measured in milliseconds or microseconds. 🕰️
2️⃣ It involves steps like data initiation, encapsulation, transmission, processing, propagation, and reaching the destination. 📡

✪ What is System Latency?: 💻
1️⃣ System latency refers to the overall time it takes for a request to go from its origin in the system to its destination and receive a response. 🔄
2️⃣ It encompasses processing time on both client and server, network transfers, and rendering delays. 📊
