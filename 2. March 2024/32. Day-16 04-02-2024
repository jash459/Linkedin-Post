Lost in a sea of Microservices? Service Discovery is your Captain! 🚢
Building complex applications with microservices can be amazing for scalability, but it can also get confusing when services need to find each other. 🤔

Here's your cheat sheet 💡

📝 Understanding Service Discovery in Microservices-Based Applications

1️⃣ Microservices require a mechanism for services to use each other without knowing their exact location.
2️⃣ This tutorial explores the concept of Service Discovery.

🔍 What Is Service Discovery?:

1️⃣ Service Discovery helps in knowing the locations of microservice instances and acts as a registry for their addresses.🗺️
2️⃣ It is vital in a dynamic microservices-based application where instances have dynamically assigned network paths.🔄

🔥 The Need for Service Discovery:

1️⃣ Without Service Discovery, service locations become coupled, leading to a difficult-to-maintain system.🔗
2️⃣ It is essential when constantly destroying and distributing new instances of services in a cloud-based application.🔗

🔄 How Does Service Discovery Work?:

1️⃣ Service Discovery involves registration and finding mechanisms for service instances.🔄
2️⃣ It enables clients to make direct requests to the service provider.🔗

🛠️ Service Discovery Implementations:

1️⃣ Client-Side Discovery involves the Service Consumer determining the network locations of available service instances and load balancing requests between them.🔍
2️⃣ Server-Side Discovery uses an intermediary, such as a Load Balancer, to route requests to available service instances.🔄

📚 What Is Service Registry?:

1️⃣ The Service Registry contains network locations of service instances and must be highly available and up-to-date.🗺️
2️⃣ It can use either self-registration by service instances or third-party registration managed centrally within a dedicated service.🔄

🎯 Conclusion:

1️⃣ Service Discovery is crucial in a microservice application with dynamic network locations for effective communication.🌐
2️⃣ It provides a mechanism for services to be discovered, registered, and de-registered based on usage.🔍
