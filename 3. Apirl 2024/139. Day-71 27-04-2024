Ready to master the art of Kubernetes scaling? 🤔  Let's dive in!

✪ Kubernetes Autoscaling Methods:

→  Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA): 
1️⃣  Automatically adds or removes pod replicas. 🚀
2️⃣  Managed by the Kubernetes controller manager and runs as a control loop. 🔄
3️⃣  Uses resource metrics or custom metrics for autoscaling. 📊
4️⃣  Best practices include configuring resource requests for pods and preferring custom metrics. 💡

→  Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA): 
1️⃣  Automatically adds or adjusts CPU and memory reservations for pods. 💻
2️⃣  Uses live usage data to set limits on container resources. 📈
3️⃣  Best practices involve avoiding simultaneous use with HPA and utilizing it alongside Cluster Autoscaler. 🚫

→  Cluster Autoscaler: 
1️⃣  Automatically adds or removes nodes based on all pods’ requested resources. 🔄
2️⃣  Loops through checking unschedulable pods and trying to consolidate pods. 🔄
3️⃣  Best practices include ensuring resource availability for the Cluster Autoscaler pod and defining resource requests for all pods. 💡
