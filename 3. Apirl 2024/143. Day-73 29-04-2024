Ready to level up your Kubernetes storage game? 🤔

✪ What is Kubernetes CSI?
1️⃣ Kubernetes CSI is a Kubernetes-specific implementation of the Container Storage Interface (CSI).🚀
2️⃣ CSI standardizes the connectivity between storage systems and container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.🌐
3️⃣ It allows third-party storage vendors to deploy plugins for new storage systems without altering Kubernetes core code.🔌

✪ The Need for CSI
1️⃣ Before CSI, Kubernetes relied on in-tree k8s volume plugins.🌳
2️⃣ Flex-volume attempted to address limitations but had issues like root access requirements and OS dependencies.⚙️
3️⃣ CSI uses containerization and standard k8s primitives for out-of-tree storage plugins.📦

✪ How to Use a CSI Volume?
→ Dynamic Provisioning
1️⃣ Enable dynamic creation of PersistentVolumes linked to a CSI storage plugin through a StorageClass.🔄
2️⃣ Data persistence is on the defined storage device.💾

→ Manual Provisioning
1️⃣ Manually provision volumes in Kubernetes for direct workload use.💻

✪ Building Your Own CSI Driver for Kubernetes
1️⃣ CSI Driver Components:🔧
2️⃣ Controller Component:⚙️
3️⃣ Implements a CSI Controller service and interacts with Kubernetes objects.🚪
4️⃣ Includes sidecars like external-provisioner, external-attacher, and external-snapshotter.🛠️
5️⃣ Per-Node Component:📦
6️⃣ Deploys across all nodes via a DaemonSet and communicates with kubelet for attaching/mounting volumes.📡

✪ Deployment Recommendations
1️⃣ Develop a container for the volume plugin behavior complying with CSI specifications.🛠️
2️⃣ Group the volume driver container with Kubernetes-provided containers for smoother operations.🔄
3️⃣ Enable privileged pods and mount propagation for successful CSI driver deployment.🔒
