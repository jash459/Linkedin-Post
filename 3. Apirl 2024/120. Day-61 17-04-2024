Ever wondered how the internet actually works? 🤔  Let's dive into the magic!

✪ Key Layers:

1️⃣ Application Layer: Handles end-to-end communication (HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, NTP).🚀
2️⃣ Transport Layer: Ensures packets arrive in order and without errors (TCP, UDP).🌐
3️⃣ Internet Layer: Responsible for logical data transmission over networks (IP, ICMP, ARP).🔗
4️⃣ Data Link Layer: Identifies network protocol types and provides error prevention and framing.🔒
5️⃣ Physical Layer: Focuses on network communications and data generation.⚡

✪ TCP vs. IP:

1️⃣ IP (Internet Protocol): Finds the destination for data transmission.🎯
2️⃣ TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Sends and receives data.🔄
#tcp

✪ TCP/IP Model Working:

1️⃣ Divides data into packets at the sender's end and recombines them at the receiver's end for accurate data transfer.📦
#ip

✪ Comparison with OSI Model:

1️⃣ TCP/IP model has fewer layers (four or five) compared to the OSI model with seven layers.📊
2️⃣ TCP/IP model integrates session and presentation layers into the application layer directly.🔌
#osimodel

✪ Common Internet Protocols:

1️⃣ Examples include HTTP for web communication, FTP for file transfer, and SMTP for email communication.📧
#protocols

✪ Difference between TCP/IP and OSI Models:

1️⃣ TCP/IP provides connectionless services at the network layer and connections via the transport layer, while OSI has separate layers for these functions.🔗
2️⃣ OSI model's transport layer ensures packet delivery but not in TCP/IP.📮
#models

P.S.  Understanding these layers is like unlocking the secrets of the digital universe! 😉
