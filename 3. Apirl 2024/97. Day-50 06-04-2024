Tired of trying to figure out which Kubernetes service is right for you? 🤔

✪ Types of Kubernetes Services:

→ ClusterIP:
1️⃣  Default service type. 🌐
2️⃣  Pods are only accessible from within the cluster. 🔒
3️⃣  Example: A service exposing a database to other applications within the cluster. 🚀 
#ClusterIP

→ NodePort:
1️⃣  Exposes a port on each node in the cluster. 🔄
2️⃣  Traffic is forwarded to the ClusterIP. 🚦
3️⃣  Example: An application that needs to be accessible from outside the cluster, but doesn't require a load balancer. 🌍 
#NodePort

→ LoadBalancer:
1️⃣  Configures external load balancers to expose services. ⚖️
2️⃣  Useful for exposing services to the internet or other external networks. 🌐
3️⃣  Example: A web application that needs to scale and be accessible to the public. 🚀 
#LoadBalancer

→ ExternalName:
1️⃣  Maps a service to a DNS name instead of using a selector. 🔗
2️⃣  Useful for integrating with external services. 🌐
3️⃣  Example: Mapping an internal service to an external DNS name for access. 🚀 
#ExternalName
