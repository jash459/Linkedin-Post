1️⃣  In Kubernetes, a service is an entity that represents a set of pods running an application or functional component.🌐
2️⃣  The service holds access policies and is responsible for enforcing these policies for incoming requests.🔒
3️⃣  The need for services arises from the fact that pods in Kubernetes are short-lived and can be replaced at any time.⏳
4️⃣  Kubernetes guarantees the availability of a given pod and replica but not the liveness of individual pods.❌
