Ever wondered what's the big deal about SQL and NoSQL? 🤔 Let's break it down, shall we?

Differences between NoSQL and SQL databases:

✪ Relational databases
1️⃣  Optimal workloads: Designed for transactional and strongly consistent OLTP applications. Also good for OLAP.🔍
2️⃣  Data model: Normalizes data into tables of rows and columns with a strict schema.📊
3️⃣  ACID properties: Provides atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability.🔒
4️⃣  Performance: Generally dependent on the disk subsystem and requires query optimization.⚙️
5️⃣  Scale: Typically scales up by increasing hardware capabilities or scales out by adding replicas.📈
6️⃣  APIs: Uses structured query language (SQL) for data communication.💬

✪ NoSQL databases
1️⃣  Optimal workloads: Designed for various data access patterns, including low-latency applications and analytics over semi-structured data.🚀
2️⃣  Data model: Provides a variety of models like key-value, document, graph, and column optimized for performance and scale.🔑
3️⃣  ACID properties: Offers trade-offs by relaxing some ACID properties for more flexible data models.🔄
4️⃣  Performance: Dependent on hardware cluster size, network latency, and calling application.🚄
5️⃣  Scale: Typically partitionable, enabling consistent performance at near-boundless scale.🌐
6️⃣  APIs: Uses object-based APIs for storing and retrieving data structures.🔄
