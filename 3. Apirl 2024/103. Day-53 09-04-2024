Tired of manually configuring traffic into your Kubernetes cluster? 🤔 Discover the power of Kubernetes Ingress!

Content:

✪ What is Kubernetes Ingress?
1️⃣  Ingress refers to the act of entering, similar in Kubernetes—traffic entering/exiting the cluster.🚪
#Kubernetes

✪ Kubernetes ingress & egress
1️⃣  Ingress is a Kubernetes resource for DNS routing configurations, with the ingress controller managing routing based on rules. 🛡️
2️⃣  Without ingress, you'd use a LoadBalancer service; with ingress, there's a reverse proxy layer (controller) between the load balancer and Kubernetes services. 🔀
# LoadBalancer

✪ Before Kubernetes Ingress?
1️⃣  Previously, custom Nginx or HAproxy Kubernetes deployments acted as LoadBalancers for routing traffic. 🔄
2️⃣  Kubernetes ingress simplifies this by using native Kubernetes objects for routing rules, managed by ingress controllers. 🛠️

✪ How Does Kubernetes Ingress work?
1️⃣  Kubernetes Ingress Resource stores DNS routing rules. 📚
2️⃣  Kubernetes Ingress Controller (e.g., Nginx/HAProxy) routes traffic based on rules applied through ingress resources. 🌐
