Ready to upgrade your data transfer game? Let's dive into the world of transmission media! ⚡️

✪ Transmission Media:
1️⃣  It is a communication channel that transmits information from the source to the receiver through electromagnetic signals, serving as a physical path for data transfer. It can include materials such as copper, glass, or air.🌐 
2️⃣  Transmission media can be classified based on their nature, such as guided and unguided media.Guided media, like twisted pair cables, have physical paths that guide the signal. Unguided media, like wireless signals, do not have a fixed path. 🔍

✪ Types of Transmission Media:
1️⃣  Guided Media: Also known as wired or bounded media, includes twisted pair cable, optical fiber cable, coaxial cable, stripline, and microstripline.Twisted pair cables are commonly used in telephone and computer. networks.They are cost-effective and easy to install.🔗
2️⃣  Unguided Media: Also known as unbounded or wireless media, includes radio waves, infrared, and microwaves.Infrared is used for short-range communication like remote controls.Radio waves are used for long-range communication, such as in broadcasting.📶
