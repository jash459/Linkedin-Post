Ever wondered how your computer knows its own name on the network? 🤔  It's all thanks to the MAC address!

✪ MAC Address Definition:
1️⃣  A MAC address is a unique 48-bit hardware number assigned to a network card during manufacturing. 🔗
2️⃣  It is also known as the Physical Address of a network device and is used at the Data Link Layer. 🔒

✪ Format of MAC Address:
1️⃣  A MAC Address is represented as a 12-digit hexadecimal number, often shown as colon-hexadecimal notation. 🔄
2️⃣  The first 6 digits identify the manufacturer, while the last 6 digits represent the unique network interface controller. 🆔

✪ Types of MAC Address:
1️⃣  Unicast, Multicast, and Broadcast are the three types, each serving specific communication purposes. 📡
2️⃣  MAC addresses can also be classified based on their assignment, such as burned-in addresses (BIAs) and universally administered addresses (UAAs).🔄

✪ Reason for IP and MAC Addresses:
1️⃣  IP addresses are used for end-to-end delivery, while MAC addresses facilitate hop-to-hop delivery in the OSI model. 🔄
2️⃣  IP addresses are essential for network communication because they uniquely identify devices on a network, enabling data to be routed correctly.🔒
