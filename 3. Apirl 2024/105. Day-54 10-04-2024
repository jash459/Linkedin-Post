Ever wondered how those fancy apps on your Kubernetes cluster get their traffic? 🤔 Let's unravel the mystery of the Kubernetes Ingress Controller! 👇

✪ Kubernetes Ingress Controller: The Basics

1️⃣  Ingress controller is not a native Kubernetes implementation, so it doesn’t come default in the cluster. 🌐
2️⃣  We need to set up an ingress controller for the ingress rules to work. Several open-source and enterprise ingress controllers are available. 🚀
3️⃣  An ingress controller is typically a reverse web proxy server implementation in the cluster. It is deployed as a Kubernetes deployment and exposed as a service type LoadBalancer. 🔄

✪ How Does an Ingress Controller Work?

1️⃣  Nginx is one of the widely used ingress controllers. 🌟
2️⃣  The nginx.conf file inside the Nginx controller pod is a lua template that can talk to Kubernetes ingress API and get the latest values for traffic routing in real-time. 📃
3️⃣  The Nginx controller talks to the Kubernetes ingress API to check if there is any rule created for traffic routing. 🚦
4️⃣  If it finds any ingress rules, the Nginx controller generates a routing configuration inside /etc/nginx/conf.d location inside each nginx pod. 📝
5️⃣  For each ingress resource you create, Nginx generates a configuration inside /etc/nginx/conf.d location. 📦
6️⃣  The main /etc/nginx/nginx.conf file contains all the configurations from etc/nginx/conf.d. 📂

✪ Ingress & Ingress Controller Architecture

1️⃣  Here is the architecture diagram that explains the ingress & ingress controller setup on a Kubernetes cluster. 🏗️
2️⃣  It shows ingress rules routing traffic to two payment & auth applications. 💳\
3️⃣  Now if you look at the architecture, it will make more sense and you will probably be able to understand how each ingress workflow works. 🔄
