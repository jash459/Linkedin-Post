Tired of slow pod scheduling in your Kubernetes cluster? 🤔 Let's dive into the secrets of efficient scheduling!

✪ Definition of Scheduling in Kubernetes:
1️⃣ Refers to matching pods to nodes, ensuring that Kubelet can run them on available nodes. 🔄
2️⃣ The Kubernetes scheduler takes new pods from a queue and schedules them on nodes. 🗓️
#Definition

✪ Kube Scheduler:
1️⃣ Default scheduler for Kubernetes that runs as part of the control plane. 🚀
2️⃣ Responsible for selecting optimal nodes for newly created or unscheduled pods. 🎯
#Kube Scheduler

✪ Filters:
1️⃣ Default scheduler registers a series of predicates to apply filters to pods. 🔍
2️⃣ The FeasibleNodes mechanism can be used to increase performance for scheduling large-scale clusters. 🚀
#Filters

✪ Prioritize:
1️⃣ Pod priority allows scoring nodes to find the most appropriate node for a pod. 🎯
2️⃣ Utilizes Map and Reduce arguments in the PriorityConfig file. 🗺️

✪ Methods Used for Scheduling Pods:
→ Node Selector:
1️⃣ Simplest recommendation for scheduling a pod on a specific node using key-value pairs. 🔄
2️⃣ Node can be labeled using kubectl label nodes <node-name> disktype=ssd. 🔖

→ Node Affinity/Anti-Affinity:
1️⃣ Fixing rules for node selection, defined using custom labels and selectors. 🚥
2️⃣ Can be required or preferred rules in node affinity and anti-affinity. ⭐

→ Taints and Tolerations
1️⃣ Allows marking nodes as unschedulable and enabling pods to tolerate the taints. 🚫
2️⃣ Useful for situations where most pods should avoid scheduling onto certain nodes. 🛑

→ Taints/Toleration and Node Affinity:
1️⃣ Combining taints/tolerations and node affinity to dedicated nodes for specific pods. 🔄

✪ Status Quo:
1️⃣ The main scheduling method of the Kubernetes scheduler is Pod-by-Pod. 🔄
2️⃣ Current shortcomings include slow pod scheduling in large clusters and lack of excellent scalability. 📉
