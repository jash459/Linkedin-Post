IBM + HashiCorp =  🤯🤯  What does this mean for the future of cloud?

✪ IBM Makes a $6.4 Billion Bet on HashiCorp: A Game-Changer in the Cloud Race?

1️⃣  IBM just dropped $6.4 billion on HashiCorp, the brains behind Terraform, Vault, Consul... basically the hottest tools in DevOps and infrastructure right now 🔥

2️⃣  HashiCorp's tools have the juice to boost IBM's hybrid cloud game. 🚀
3️⃣  Big potential for awesome new solutions... if they play their cards right. 😉
