Ever wondered how your phone, laptop, and smart TV can all use the same WiFi without crashing the party? 🤔

✪ What are Multiple Access Protocols?
1️⃣  They allow multiple nodes or users to access a shared network channel to transmit data.🔄
2️⃣  Multiple Access Protocols help in managing how devices share the same communication medium without interfering with each other.📶
#Protocols

✪ Data Link Control:
1️⃣  Handles data transmission between two nodes. 🔄
2️⃣  Ensures reliable message transmission with methods like framing, error control, and flow control. 🔒

✪ Multiple Access Control:
1️⃣  Required when multiple stations need to access a channel simultaneously to prevent collision and crosstalk. ⚠️
2️⃣  Achieved through various techniques like CSMA/CD, CSMA/CA, and Token Passing. ⚙️

✪ Classification of Multiple Access Protocols:
→  Random Access Protocol:
1️⃣  ALOHA: Used for wireless LAN and shared mediums, may cause collisions. 💥
2️⃣  CSMA: Ensures fewer collisions by sensing the medium before transmitting data. 🚦
3️⃣  CSMA/CD: Stops data transmission upon detecting collisions. 🛑
4️⃣  CSMA/CA: Uses collision avoidance methods like interframe space, contention window, and acknowledgements. 🔄

→  Controlled Access Protocol Subpoints:
1️⃣  Token Passing: Stations exchange tokens to access the channel. 🔑
2️⃣  Polling: Stations take turns to send data. 🔄
3️⃣  Reservation: Stations exchange information to determine the sending authority. 📝

→  Channelization Subpoints:
1️⃣  Frequency Division Multiple Access: Splits available bandwidth into equal bands for each station. 📶
2️⃣  Time Division Multiple Access: Time slots are allocated for stations to prevent collisions. ⏰
3️⃣  Code Division Multiple Access: Allows simultaneous transmission of data from multiple stations without dividing time or bandwidth. 🔢
