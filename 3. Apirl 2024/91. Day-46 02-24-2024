Ready to level up your container game? Time to talk StatefulSets! 🧩

✪ Purpose of StatefulSets:

1️⃣  Manage applications needing persistent storage or stable, unique network identities.🔒
2️⃣  Provide guarantees for ordered deployment, scaling, and rolling updates.🔄
#StatefulSets

✪ Components:

1️⃣  StatefulSet manages a group of Pods based on an identical container spec.📦
2️⃣  Maintains a sticky identity for each Pod.🏷️
3️⃣  Uses VolumeClaimTemplates for stable storage using PersistentVolumes.💾
#StatefulSets

✪ Pod Identity:

1️⃣  Pods have unique identity with an ordinal index, stable network identity, and stable storage.🔢
2️⃣  Pod hostname is derived from StatefulSet name and ordinal of the Pod.🏷️
#PodIdentity

✪ Deployment & Scaling:

1️⃣  Pods are created sequentially from 0 to N-1 replicas and terminated in reverse order.⏮️
2️⃣  Scaling operations require predecessors to be ready before a Pod is scaled.📈
3️⃣  Avoid setting TerminationGracePeriodSeconds to 0 for safety reasons.⚠️
#DeploymentScaling

✪ Update Strategies:

1️⃣  StatefulSet can use "OnDelete" or "RollingUpdate" strategies for updating Pods.🔄
2️⃣  RollingUpdate strategy updates Pods sequentially from largest to smallest ordinal.🔄
#UpdateStrategies

✪ PersistentVolumeClaim Retention:

1️⃣  Policies control whether PVCs are deleted during StatefulSet deletion or scaling.🗑️
2️⃣  Retain or delete PVCs based on specified policies.🔄
#PersistentVolumeClaimRetention

✪ Replicas:

1️⃣  Replicas field Specifies the desired number of Pods.👥
#Replicas
