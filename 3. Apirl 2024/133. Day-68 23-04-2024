Celebrating 500 days of LeetCode challenges! ðŸŽ‰.

It has been a long and interesting journey. I have learned a lot about algorithms and problem-solving, and my codingskills have improved a lot.

Here are a few tips from my experience:
1. Start with the easy problems to build confidence.
2. Don't hesitate to ask for help when needed.
3. If you're a beginner, take it topic by topic, not randomly to stay motivated.
4. Keep pushing forward, even when it gets tough.

Consistency is the biggest challenge, so practice a few problems daily.
