Ever wondered how the internet actually gets your message from Point A to Point B? 🤔



Let's break down the magic of the internet! Meet the TCP/IP model – the foundation of how information travels online. ✨



✪ TCP/IP Model and its Functionality:



1️⃣  The TCP/IP model is a concise alternative to the OSI model, featuring four layers. 🔗

2️⃣  Its primary function is to ensure the reliable and accurate transfer of data from one device to another through packet division and recombination. 🔄

3️⃣  The TCP/IP model's layers are the Application, Transport, Internet, and Link layers, each serving specific functions in data transmission. 💻 

#DataTransfer



✪ Difference between TCP and IP:



1️⃣  TCP and IP have distinct roles in data transmission. IP is responsible for locating the data's destination, while TCP manages the sending and receiving of the data. 🎯

Sure, here are shorter versions:

2️⃣  TCP ensures error-free and ordered data transmission by reordering and requesting retransmission of lost packets. 🔀

3️⃣  IP provides addressing and routing for packets, ensuring they reach the correct destination on a network. 🌐

#TransmissionRoles



✪ Working of the TCP/IP Model:

1️⃣  The model segments data into packets at the sender's end and recombines them at the receiver's end to maintain data accuracy. 🔀 

2️⃣  The TCP/IP Model divides data into packets for transmission. These packets are recombined at the receiver's end to maintain data accuracy.📦

3️⃣  The model consists of four layers: Application, Transport (TCP/UDP), Network/Internet (IP), and Data Link (MAC), followed by the Physical Layer.🔒
