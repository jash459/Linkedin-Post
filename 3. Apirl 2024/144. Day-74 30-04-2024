 Ready to stop those network traffic jams? 🚦 Let's talk channel allocation!

✪ Channel Allocation:
1️⃣  Process of dividing a single channel for multiple users for specific tasks, such as data transmission or communication. 📡
2️⃣  Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) is a technique used for fixed and small user groups, where the frequency band is divided into smaller sub-bands, each allocated to a user or a communication channel. 🔄

✪ Static Channel Allocation in LANs and MANs:
1️⃣  Traditional approach using FDM, where the available frequency band is divided into N equal parts for N users or communication channels. 📟
2️⃣  Each user or channel is assigned a specific frequency band, and private frequency bands are often used to avoid interference between different users or channels. 🔀

✪ Formulas:
1️⃣  Mean time delay T calculation is essential for evaluating the performance of channel allocation schemes, providing insights into the average time taken for a packet or message to be transmitted through the network. ⏳
2️⃣  FDM time calculation considering variables like the number of users, size of data packets, and available bandwidth helps in determining the optimal allocation of channels to maximize throughput and minimize delays. ⏲️

✪ Dynamic Channel Allocation:
1️⃣  Channels are not permanently allocated in dynamic schemes. Instead, channels are allocated on-demand from a central pool of available channels, allowing for more flexible and efficient use of resources. 🔁
2️⃣  Dynamic allocation optimizes bandwidth usage by allocating channels based on current demand, speeding up transmissions and reducing delays. 💹

✪ Types of Dynamic Allocation:
1️⃣  Centralised Allocation involves a central pool for channel assignments, where a central entity manages and allocates channels based on demand. 🎯
2️⃣  Distributed Allocation is decentralized but coordinated, where different entities collaborate to dynamically allocate channels based on local demand and available resources. 🌐

✪ Assumptions in Channel Allocation:
1️⃣  Station Model assumes N independent stations with arrival rate, each requiring access to the shared channel for data transmission. 🚉
2️⃣  Single Channel Assumption implies that all stations share a single channel for communication, simplifying analysis but may not reflect real-world scenarios where multiple channels are available. 🔂

PS: Don't forget those assumptions!  Understanding things like station models, single channels, and collisions helps you build a rock-solid channel allocation strategy. 😉
