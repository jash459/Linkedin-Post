Ready to level up your networking knowledge? 🤔  Let's break down the key differences between hubs, switches, and routers!

Hub:
1️⃣  Operates at the physical layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model. 🔌
2️⃣  Functions based on broadcasting signals to all connected ports. 📡
3️⃣  Acts as a multiport repeater without intelligence for selective communication. 🔄
4️⃣  Typically less expensive compared to switches and routers. 💰
5️⃣  Speed ranges from 10Mbps to 100Mbps in modern hubs. 🚀

Switch:
1️⃣  Works at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. 🔗
2️⃣  Uses MAC addresses to direct messages to specific devices effectively. 📨
3️⃣  Provides better connections through features like flooding, filtering, and frame transmission. 🌐
4️⃣  More intelligent than hubs, selectively routing messages. 🧠
5️⃣  More expensive than hubs. 💸

Router:
1️⃣  Operates at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model. 🌐
2️⃣  Routes data based on IP addresses. 🛣️
3️⃣  Multiport and sophisticated, making decisions about the best route for data transmission. 🧭
4️⃣  Requires at least two networks to connect. 🌐
5️⃣  Handles LANs, MANs, and WANs routing. 🌍
