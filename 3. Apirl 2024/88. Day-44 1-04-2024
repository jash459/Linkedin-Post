Ever felt like your system could use a dose of predictability? 🤔 Consistency is the secret ingredient!

✪ Let's talk about the power of consistency in system design...

1️⃣  Correctness: Ensures data accessed by different parts of the system is accurate and up-to-date, producing correct results.🎯
2️⃣  Reliability: Reduces errors and inconsistencies, leading to more reliable and predictable system behavior.🛡️
3️⃣  Data Integrity: Helps maintain data integrity by preventing corruption and loss through correct application and propagation of updates.🔒
4️⃣  Concurrency Control: Manages access and modifications to data in multi-user or distributed systems, preventing conflicts.⚔️
5️⃣  User Experience: Enhances user experience by providing a seamless and predictable interaction with the system.🚀

✪ Types of Consistency:

→ Strong Consistency:
1️⃣  Also known as linearizability or strict consistency.
2️⃣  Guarantees every read operation receives the most recent write or an error.🔍
3️⃣  Requires coordination between nodes, impacting performance and availability.⚙️
#strongconsistency

→ Eventual Consistency:
1️⃣  Allows temporary divergence of data replicas but ensures eventual convergence.🔄
2️⃣  Improves availability and performance in distributed systems.🌐
3️⃣  Guarantees all updates will be propagated and reconciled eventually.🔄
#eventualconsistency

→ Causal Consistency:
1️⃣  Preserves the causality between related events.🔄
2️⃣  Ensures all nodes agree on the ordering of events.🔗
3️⃣  Important for maintaining application semantics and correctness.🧩
#causalconsistency

→ Read-your-Writes Consistency:
1️⃣  Guarantees a client can always read a value it has written.📝
2️⃣  Ensures immediate observation of own updates, critical for session consistency.🔍
#readyourwrites

→ Monotonic Consistency:
1️⃣  Ensures a client never observes a conflicting order of updates.🔄
2️⃣  Prevents reverting to previous states or inconsistent sequences of updates.🚫
#monotonicconsistency

→ Monotonic Reads and Writes:
1️⃣  Guarantees clients observe monotonically increasing sequences of values or updates.📈
2️⃣  Ensures clients always see the most recent data and writes are applied in the same order.🔄

→ Weak Consistency:
1️⃣  Provides the weakest guarantee among consistency models.🛡️
2️⃣  Allows significant divergence between replicas and only guarantees eventual propagation.🔄
3️⃣  Prioritizes low latency and high availability over strict consistency.🕰️
