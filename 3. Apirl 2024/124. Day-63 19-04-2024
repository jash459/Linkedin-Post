Ready to level-up your network knowledge? 🤔 Let's dive into the fascinating world of transmission modes!

Transmission Modes in Computer Networks

✪ Simplex Mode : Communication is unidirectional, allowing data transmission in only one direction.
   
→ Advantages:
1️⃣  Easy and reliable mode of communication.🔌
2️⃣  Cost-effective, requiring only one communication channel.💰
3️⃣  No need for coordination between the transmitting and receiving devices.🤝
   
→ Disadvantages:
1️⃣  Only one-way communication is possible.🔃
2️⃣  Inability to verify if transmitted data has been received correctly.🧮
3️⃣  Not suitable for bidirectional communication applications.🚷
#simplexmode

✪ Half-Duplex Mode : Each station can transmit and receive, but not simultaneously.
   
→ Advantages:
1️⃣  Allows bidirectional communication.🔄
2️⃣  More efficient than simplex mode.🚀
3️⃣  Less expensive than full-duplex mode.💸
   
→ Disadvantages:
1️⃣  Less reliable than full-duplex mode.🔓
2️⃣  Delay between transmission and reception.⏳
3️⃣  Requires coordination between transmitting and receiving devices.🕰️
#halfduplexmode

✪ Full-Duplex Mode : Both stations can transmit and receive simultaneously.
   
→ Advantages:
1️⃣  Allows simultaneous bidirectional communication, ideal for real-time applications.⏱️
2️⃣  Most efficient mode of communication.📈
3️⃣  Provides a high level of reliability and accuracy.🎯
   
→ Disadvantages:
1️⃣  Most expensive mode, requiring two communication channels.💸💸
2️⃣  More complex than simplex and half-duplex modes.🔧
3️⃣  May not be necessary for some types of communication.🛑

P.S.  Ever wondered why your video call sometimes lags? That could be a hint that you're not in full-duplex mode. 😉
