Ready to lock down your sensitive data in Kubernetes? 🔐

✪ What are Kubernetes Secrets?
1️⃣ Kubernetes Secret is an object that contains a small amount of sensitive data such as login usernames, passwords, tokens, and keys.
2️⃣ The primary purpose of Secrets is to reduce the risk of exposing sensitive data while deploying applications on Kubernetes.

✪ Key Points about Kubernetes Secrets:
1️⃣ Secrets are created outside of Pods, necessitating the creation of a Secret before any Pod can use it. 🔒
2️⃣ When a Secret is created, it is stored inside the Kubernetes data store, specifically in an etcd database on the Kubernetes Control Plane. 🗄️
3️⃣ During the creation of a Secret, the data and/or stringData fields are specified, with the values for all the data field keys being base64-encoded strings. However, arbitrary strings can be specified for the stringData field if base64 encoding is not desired. 📝
4️⃣ The size of each Secret is limited to 1MB to discourage the creation of excessively large secrets to prevent memory exhaustion in kube-apiserver and kubelet. 📏
5️⃣ The immutable property can be set to true when creating a Secret, making them immutable and protecting them from accidental or unwanted updates that could cause application outages. 🛡️
6️⃣ After creating a Secret, it can be injected into a Pod either by mounting it as data volumes, exposing it as environment variables, or as imagePullSecrets. 🚀

✪ Types of Kubernetes Secrets:
1️⃣ Opaque Secrets: Default Secret type used to store arbitrary user-defined data. 🌑
2️⃣ Service Account Token Secrets: Used to store a token credential that identifies a service account. The https://lnkd.in/gr4Z9pcq annotation must be set to an existing service account name. 🤖
3️⃣ Docker Config Secrets: Store credentials for accessing a container image registry using kubernetes.io/dockercfg or https://lnkd.in/gvnSV6tz values. 🐳
4️⃣ Basic Authentication Secrets: Store credentials required for basic authentication with keys such as username and password. 🔑
5️⃣ SSH Authentication Secrets: Used for storing data utilized in SSH authentication, requiring a ssh-privatekey key-value pair in the data (or stringData) field. 🚪
6️⃣ TLS Secrets: Store a certificate and its associated key used for TLS, requiring tls.key and tls.crt keys in the data (or stringData) field. 🛡️
7️⃣ Bootstrap Token Secrets: Store bootstrap token data during the node bootstrap process, named in the form bootstrap-token- in the kube-system namespace.
