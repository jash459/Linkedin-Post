✪ How to Create a Kubernetes Secret:



→  Create the Secret:

1️⃣  Use `kubectl create secret` command. 🔒

2️⃣  Create from literal: ```shell kubectl create secret generic my-secret --from-literal=password=abc123   ```

3️⃣  Create from file: ```shell kubectl create secret generic my-secret --from-file=ssh-privatekey=/path/to/privatekey --from-file=ssh-publickey=/path/to/publickey ```



→  Use the Secret in a Pod:

1️⃣  Add a volume that references the Secret. 📦

2️⃣  Mount the volume into the container using YAML definitions. 🗃️



→  Use the Kubernetes Secret in a Deployment:

1️⃣  Add an environment variable in the Deployment definition. 🛠️

2️⃣  Reference the Secret with `valueFrom` and `secretKeyRef`. 🗝️



→  View and Modify Kubernetes Secrets:

1️⃣  View: `kubectl get secret <secret-name>`. 👀

✪ How Secure are Kubernetes Secrets?

1️⃣  Kubernetes secrets are encrypted using the AES-256 encryption algorithm. 🔒

2️⃣  Access to secrets is controlled by Kubernetes RBAC rules. 🛡️

3️⃣  They are stored in memory only when used by a pod and are deleted once the pod terminates. 🗑️

4️⃣  However, potential security risks exist, such as unauthorized access to the cluster or a pod, compromising secret security. ⚠️
