Ready to decode the map of your business communications? 🗺️ Let's talk network topologies!

✪ What is network topology?

→ Network topology refers to the arrangement of nodes and links in a network. Different types of network topologies include:
1️⃣  Bus topology: Nodes are connected in a linear fashion, and data transmission occurs in one direction. 🚌
2️⃣  Ring topology: Nodes are connected in a circular manner, allowing bi-directional data flow but vulnerable to single node failures. 🔗
3️⃣  Star topology: Nodes are connected to a central server, offering better performance and reliability. ⭐️
4️⃣  Mesh topology: Every node is connected to multiple other nodes, providing redundancy and fault tolerance. 🕸

✪ Types of enterprise computer networks:

1️⃣  Local area network (LAN): Connects devices within a limited area, like an office. 🏢
2️⃣  Wide area network (WAN): Spans larger areas, cities, or countries for long-distance communication. 🌐
3️⃣  SD-WAN: Uses software to create a virtual WAN, offering flexibility and control. 💻
4️⃣  Cloud networks: Leverage cloud-based infrastructure for network services, offering scalability and cost-effectiveness for modern enterprises. ☁️
