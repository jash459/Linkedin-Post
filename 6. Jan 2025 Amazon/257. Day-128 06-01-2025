🌟 Hello everyone, I am extremely happy to share that I have joined Amazon as a System Development Engineer! 🎉 Officially an Amazonian now.

This is a dream come true and the achievement of one of my biggest goals. Finally, all the hard work has paid off. The journey wasn’t easy, but voh kahte hena, "Mehnat ka phal meetha hota hai" and today, I truly feel it.

A heartfelt thanks to my parents for their love, support, and for always being my biggestw strength. This achievement wouldn’t have been possible without you.

A huge shoutout to my inspiration, Raj Vikramaditya (aka Striver), for his incredible DSA content and guidance, which played a key role in this journey.

Cheers to my new beginnings…. ❤️
