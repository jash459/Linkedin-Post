Hey LinkedIn community! 👋 In today's tutorial, we'll walk through the step-by-step process of installing Docker on an AWS EC2 instance. Let's dive in!

1. Launching AWS EC2 Instance:
   . Named our instance "docker demo"
   . Selected instance type: T2 micro
   . Chose Amazon Linux machine
   . Used an existing key pair (or created a new one)
   . Allowed HTTP and HTTPS in security groups

2. Connecting to the Instance:
   . Established connection using a simple connect method

3. Performing Docker Setup:
   . Updated the instance: `sudo yum update -y`
   . Installed Docker: `sudo yum install docker -y`
   . Started Docker service: `sudo service docker start`
   . Checked Docker status: `sudo service docker status`

4. Useful Docker Commands:
   . Command 1: Check Docker version
     "docker version"

   . Command 2: Search for Docker images
     "docker search nginx"

   . Command 3: Pull an image from Docker Hub
     "docker pull nginx"

   . Command 4: View downloaded images
     "docker images"

   . Command 5: Create a Docker container
     "docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx"

   . Command 6: Check running containers
     "docker ps"

   . Command 7: View Docker container logs
     "docker logs [container_ID]"

   . Command 8: Check Docker container network
     "docker inspect --format='{{json .NetworkSettings.Networks}}' [container_ID]"

   . Command 9: Stop a Docker container
     docker stop [container_ID]"

   . Command 10: List all containers (including exited)
     "docker ps -a"

   . Command 11: Remove a Docker container
     "docker rm [container_ID]"

   . Command 12: Remove a Docker image
     "docker rmi [image_ID]"
