Understanding Consistency Levels in Distributed Database Systems ⬇⬇

Maintaining data integrity across multiple locations can be tricky! In distributed databases, consistency ensures all copies reflect the same state, but different levels offer varying trade-offs. 🔍

Here's a breakdown: 📊

1️⃣ Introduction to Consistency:
→ Consistency is a property used in the context of distributed database systems and is discussed in relation to the CAP    Theorem.
→ It ensures that all copies of the database perform operations in a specified order to maintain a general final state.

2️⃣Levels of Consistency: 📈
→ Sequential Consistency: Writes appear in a globally ordered sequence, even if not real-time. 🔄
→ Strict Consistency: Writes are ordered based on real-time, offering the strongest consistency but impractical for large-scale systems. 🕒
→ Atomic Consistency (Linear Consistency): Highest practical level, ensuring writes appear to happen instantaneously across all replicas. ⚛️
→ Causal Consistency: Reads reflect the effects of previous writes that "caused" them. 🧠
→ Eventual Consistency: Weakest level, guaranteeing eventual consistency after a period without writes. 🔄

3️⃣Strong vs. Weak Consistency: ⚖️

→ Strong Consistency: Prioritizes data consistency over performance, ideal for critical applications. 🛡️
→ Weak Consistency: Compromises consistency for better performance, suitable for high-availability systems. 🏎️

4️⃣Beyond the Basics: 🚀

→ Atomic Consistency: Ensures write operations appear to happen instantaneously across all replicas. ⚛️
→ Linearizability: Guarantees reads always reflect the latest write, even across geographically distributed systems. 🌐
→ Causal Consistency: Ensures reads reflect the effects of previous writes that "caused" them. 🔄
→ Eventual Consistency: Offers eventual consistency after a period without writes. 🔄
→ Degree-Two Consistency: Aims to avoid cascading aborts while not guaranteeing serializability. 2️⃣
→ Cursor Stability: A specific form of Degree-Two Consistency designed for programs iterating over data using cursors. 🖱️
