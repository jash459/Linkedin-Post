🚀 Excited to share insights on Distributed Consensus & Data Replication Strategies! 🌐

Ever wondered how systems handle potential crashes and ensure data consistency? Let's dive into the Master/Slave architecture:

🔄 Replication Strategy: Avoid single points of failure by creating a backup copy of your data on a different hardware component.

🤝 Roles: In this setup, the Master receives commands and sends them to the Slave for consistent data replication. Think of them as teamwork champions!

🌐 Peer-to-Peer: If a server wants to update the Slave, it informs the Master to propagate the changes. Teamwork makes the dream work!

🤯 Split-Brain Problem: In Master/Master setups, simultaneous node and router failures can lead to inconsistencies. Solution? Add a third node to prevent chaos.

🤝 Distributed Consensus: Nodes agree on a final state, ensuring harmony in data. Various protocols like 2PC, 3PC, MVCC, and Saga orchestrate this symphony.

🚀 Sharding: Imagine breaking down responsibilities among team members. Sharding does that for data, improving system reliability and scalability.

💡 Benefits of Master/Slave: Backups, scaling out read operations, and sharding for reliability. It's like having a reliable team for your data management!
